Quarters Unity SDK - V0.5.0

Quarters SDK Unity integration:
1. Create empty game object in first loaded scene
2. Add QuartersInit component
3. Create new Quarters App https://pocketfulofquarters.com/apps/new
4. Copy your App ID and App key from Quarters dashboard to QuartersInit Unity Inspector
5. Setup deep linking depending on used platform:
    5.1 Android: In Plugins/AndroidManifest.xml swap your package name, instead of "com.quarters.example" enter your real package name from Player Settings. (this need to be done in two places in AndroidManifest)
    5.2 iOS: this is handled by post process, no additional steps are needed on iOS 



Quarters SDK is now configured to use in your Unity Project.
